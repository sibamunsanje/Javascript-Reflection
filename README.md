# Javascript-Reflection

Wednesday 11th December 2019 (Week 9)

## Abstracts steps for learning can include but are not limited to;

*Note taking - this can be used to record the process. My go-to note taking method is that of the Cornell Notes System, because it allows for questions and reflection in an organised and efficient manner. 

*Learning by translation - this is not a new concept, however, this is the first time I have actively employed this technique to my learning of code. It is when you take things that you know in one language and compare it to another language, with a particular focus on syntax, and basic functions. 

# Learning by Translation. 
## my process for learning a new language. 

This week, I learnt the importance of being able to pick up a new language, it's an important skill that i'll probably use many times when working in tech. In the few weeks that I've been coding, I've learnt that the one thing a person that wants to work in tech should learn, is HOW TO LEARN. 

First thing I did, was bmake a list of things I know in one language, and translate it to another language (this doesn't necessarily having to be in code). For instance, how many languages can you use to say the word hello? 

Next, I paired up with a colleague to complete the infamous, yet simple FizzBuzz challenge. I had already completed this exercise in Ruby a few weeks earlier, I was keen to test my ability to apply Javascript to the challenge. This was done in the JS console for practice. I've attached a picture of my notebook below, I scribbled down the key differences in syntax between the two languages.

Overall, my first dip into Javascript was not as intimidating as I'd feared, in fact, I think I like it better than Ruby. 

# My process for Learning Javascript
*What went well?
  *Noting down the differences between JS and Ruby helped re-inforce the key differences between the two languages. I noticed that JS has a tendency towards syntactic sugar. For instance, Javascript demands a semi-colon at the end of each 'sentence', where Ruby does not. An interesting example is that in Ruby, we dont have to declare the variable, yet JS demands we do. 
  
  *Moving on to a more complex programme, i.e. [JS takeawaychallenge] (https://github.com/sibamunsanje/JStakeaway-challenge), where I had to get used to the Jasmine TDD framework. 
  
*What didn't go so well?
  *Getting used to the error messages in JS was challenging, I learnt that JS is very case/spelling sensitive. It would throw
  an error such as "..is not a function", when I mispelled a word or used a small letter where I'd previously used a Capital     letter. This was annoying, to say the least, but I learnt to interpret the errors with more practice.
  
  # My Javascript Project
  
  *[JStakewaychallenge] (https://github.com/sibamunsanje/JStakeaway-challenge) used Jasmine TDD in Javascript, used constructors, added new properties to objects.
